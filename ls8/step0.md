Make a list of files here.
    - cpu.py
    - ls8.py
    - README.md
    - examples (dir)
        - ls8 files

Write a short 3-10-word description of what each file does.
    - cpu.py
        - It's the brains of the operation. We write down what each part of the CPU does, and it's loaded in the ls8.py to be executed on.
    - ls8.py
        - We initialize the cpu.py in order to run programs that we put in the CPU
    - README.md
        - Instructions for project
    - examples (dir)
        - ls8 files
            - call.ls8
                - Stores values, and calls values
            - interrrupts.ls8
                - 
            - keyboard.ls8
            - mult.ls8
            - print8.ls8
            - printstr.ls8
            - sctest.ls8
            - stack.ls8
            - stackoverflow.ls8
Note what has been implemented, and what hasn't.
    - cpu.py
        - load(), alu(), and trace() have parts of it implemented, but need a initialized CPU
